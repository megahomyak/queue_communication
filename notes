communication:
* bidirectional through two FIFO queues of bytes
* everything is a request, there are no "responses" in the raw abstraction
* responses are just requests to an endpoint that accepts responses. every response marks to what request it is directed, so ids are needed on requests if we need to get a response

possible implementation:
* {a, b, c} - no response requests
* {d, e, f} -> request - requests with responses, and each individual request endpoint requires to pass a number to it somewhere in the chain; this would be made convenient for developers through request endpoint wrappers
* all responses later get to either a unified "response" endpoint or to new individually registered callback endpoints (that will allow to have a separate id generator for each request-with-response endpoint, but having it be separate isn't necessary; in fact, one generator can be shared with all requestors that need to generate ids)
